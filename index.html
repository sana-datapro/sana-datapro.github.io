						<h1>This is my Portfolio<br />
					</h1>
						<p>I'm an aspiring data analyst/ data scientist with a deep passion for uncovering insights through data. I specialize in transforming complex datasets into actionable solutions using tools like SQL, Python, Power BI, Tableau, and the Microsoft Office Suite. Whether it's building predictive models, crafting interactive dashboards, or diving into natural language processing, I thrive on solving real-world problems with data-driven strategies.

										<h2><a href="#">Exploratory Analysis of U.S. Disaster Declarations (1953–2023)<br />

									</header>

                                    The United States experiences a wide range of natural and human-caused disasters every year, but the scale, frequency, 
									and geographic impact vary significantly across states and seasons. Decision-makers need a better understanding of long-term trends, 
									high-risk months, state-level vulnerabilities, and how FEMA assistance programs are being utilized. 
									In this project, I conducted a structured exploratory analysis of FEMA disaster declarations data from 1953 to 2023 to identify yearly and seasonal trends and 
									patterns and FEMA assistance program utilization and translated my findings into actionable insights and recommendations to support improved disaster preparedness, effective resource allocation
									and enhanced mitigation plannings in high risk regions.

										<h2><a href="#">Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) Diagnosis using Clustering<br />
										</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/als.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a complex and heterogeneous neurodegenerative disease that affects patients differently in terms of symptoms, progression rate, and response to treatment. 
									This variability makes it difficult for clinicians and researchers to design effective,
									 personalized treatment plans or to predict disease progression accurately.
									 In this project, I applied the K-Means clustering algorithm to classify patients as either affected by ALS or not, based on multiple clinical and physiological features. 
									By identifying these hidden subgroups, researchers and healthcare providers can gain deeper insights into disease mechanisms and tailor interventions to specific patient profiles.

										<h2><a href="#">Predicting Renewable energy consumption<br />
										</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/renewenergy.jpeg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>The use of renewable energy has increased over the years, driven by factors such as 
										political policies, environmental concerns, public health considerations, 
										and economic incentives. However, it is equally important to anticipate future energy demands 
										to ensure effective energy planning and optimal resource allocation. 
										In this project, I analyzed energy consumption patterns in the US from 1973 to 2024
										and developed forecasts for current and future usage using Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model.</p>

									<p>For real estate agents and sellers, fair and consistent pricing is significantly important for faster and more profitable sales.
									In this project I used linear regression algorithm to predict houses prices based on multiple features such as area, neighborhood, year built, heating, electrical systems, and several others.

									<p> To help stakeholders take decisions related to revenue forecasting, customer targeting and international expansion, I created a dashboard 
										to get insights from transactional retail data to answer questions about revenue trends, top revenue generating countries and customers, 
										and geographic demand.

										<h2><a href="#">Customers Segmentation<br />

									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/customers.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Businesses often deal with a large and diverse customer base where each customer has different preferences, 
										behaviors, and purchasing patterns. Treating all customers the same way — with identical marketing strategies, product offers, 
										or pricing — leads to inefficient marketing and lost opportunities. 
										In this project, I applied the K-Means clustering model to effectively segment a retail company's customers into meaningful and actionable groups. 
										Based on the clustering results, I developed targeted recommendations to help stakeholders optimize their marketing strategies and improve customer engagement.

									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/movie.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Manually analysing thousands of movie reviews to understand the audience sentiment is time-consuming and not efficient. 
										A statistical sentiment analysis technique will helps automatically to categorize movie reviews as positive, negative or neutral.
										In this project, I utilized the TextBlob and Vader sentiment analysers to perform sentiment classification 
										on movie reviews comparing their performance.

									<p>Receiving spams whether through emails, messages or modern channels is a huge challenge for individuals and organizations. 
										Manually identifying and filtering them is impossible and inefficient.Machine learning–based email spam detection solves 
										this by automatically classifying emails as spam or non-spam based on patterns learned from data.

										<h2><a href="#">Predicting potential Student Math Misconceptions<br />
										</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/NLP.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>In math education, students often develop misconceptions — incorrect understandings of concepts — that hinder their learning progress. 
										Identifying these misconceptions early is challenging for teachers, especially in large classes, 
										as traditional assessment methods only show whether an answer is right or wrong, not why the student made the mistake.
                                       A machine learning model that predicts student math misconceptions can automatically analyze student responses and explanations to detect patterns of misunderstanding. 
									   This helps educators provide personalized feedback and targeted interventions to improve learning outcomes.
									   In this project, I developed an NLP model (the DeBERTa v3 base model) to predict students'potential math misconceptions based on their explanations of open-ended responses.

									<p>With thousands of movies available across streaming platforms, users often struggle to find films that match their personal tastes. 
										Manually searching through large catalogs is time-consuming and overwhelming. 
										A movie recommender system addresses this problem by automatically suggesting movies based on users’ preferences and similarities among movies.
										In this project, I developed a program that recommends the top 10 highest-rated movies. This is essential 
										for enhancing user experience and driving greater profitability for companies.</p>

									<p>Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile, and prices, trading volumes, and market trends change every second across hundreds of coins and exchanges.
										 Manually collecting or updating this data from websites is time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient.
										In this project, I implemented an automated process to extract cryptocurrency market data using an API.
									This solves the problem by continuously fetching real-time and historical cryptocurrency data </p>
